The **Moon recycle station** is broken, and as a result, space debris is everywhere, destroying the Moon facilities and falling quickly to the Earth.

**Hop to the Moon**, travel along the different Earth's atmospheric layers dodging every obstacle along the way, boost your rockets and recover damage picking up power-ups.

You are the only one who can save us!

## Controls

- Use **arrow keys** or **WASD keys** to move our character.

## Score

It is divided in three sections:

- **Time**: Try to reach the moon in the shortest amount of time.
- **Points**: Get boost or damage items to get points.
- **Hits**: The less hits the better.

## Background and Technology used

I made **MoonHop** to participate in the **2020 Game Off** game jam.

I have used **Unity** as game engine and [Pixel Art CSS](https://www.pixelartcss.com/) web app to create the sprites.

## Credits
